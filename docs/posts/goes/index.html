				<h1>GOES-17 Satellite Imagery</h1>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>I had seen some cool pictures online of images obtained using a <a href="/posts/rtlsdr">SDR</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOES-17">GOES-17</a>, a geostationary weather satellite over the west coast of the US. There is also a complementary GOES-16 over the east coast. There are also a few other similar satellites from different countries, in different locations, and different communication protocols. Due to the quarantine for COVID-19, now seemed like a good time to stay at home and point a dish at the sky with hopes of receiving images.</p>
<p>The first thing I had to do was to buy a few parts to go with my <a href="/posts/rtlsdr">SDR</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005M8KU3W/">Premiertek 2.4GHz WiFi grid antenna ($75)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/sawbird-plus-goes.html">Nooelec GOES+ LNA and filter ($35)</a></p>
<p>A few SMA and type-N connectors to piece it all together (~$10)</p>
<p>Next up, I had to align the dish. I used <a href="https://www.dishpointer.com/">dishpointer</a> to get the azimuth, elevation, and skew from my current location. I then used a compass and bubble level app on my phone to set the dish up pointing in the general direction of where dishpointer told me. I knew I would refine this later as I found signal</p>
<p>My bike repair stand makes for a GREAT adjustable dish stand&hellip;</p>
<figure><img src="dish_aligned.jpg"
         alt="Aligned dish"/><figcaption>
            <p>Aligned dish</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The antenna I bought was a 2.4GHz antenna intended for extending WiFi coverage. Since the signal from GOES-17 is 1.6941 GHz, there is a common modification that people have been doing to tune the antenna closer to this frequency. The modification is either to flip the reflector around, or install a small spacer between the reflector and the feed. I opted for a ~2.5cm spacer. This is a bit of a hack since the dipoles in the feed are still tuned for 2.4GHz, but it is enough to work.</p>
<figure><img src="dish_spacer.jpg"
         alt="Spacer installed to tune antenna closer to 1.7GHz (from 2.4GHz)"/><figcaption>
            <p>Spacer installed to tune antenna closer to 1.7GHz (from 2.4GHz)</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then I connected up my low noise amplifier/filter combo from Nooelec, and connected it to my SDR. The LNA would be powered by the SDR which has a built in bias-t circuit to supply DC voltage.</p>
<figure><img src="dish_connections.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>After a bit of toying around (a lot a bit to be honest&hellip; different spacer lengths, reflector layouts, antenna orientations, etc..)&hellip; I found the signal and it was coming in pretty clearly!</p>
<figure><img src="waterfall.png"/>
</figure>

<p>I then switched to Ubuntu and built/setup <a href="https://github.com/pietern/goestools">goestools</a>. Goestools is a set of tools used to receive and decode the signal from the GOES satellite. Once I configured goestools to enable the bias-t on my sdr to provide power to the LNA, I fired it up and started adjusted the antenna slightly to try and minimize the viterbi error and minimize packet drops.</p>
<figure><img src="goesrecv.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Once this was done, I then started up goesproc and it started processing data and saving images!</p>

<p>Here is the first thing that came in!</p>

<p>Since this satellite is geostationary&hellip;I was done! I left it running for ~24 hours and stitched together the images using <a href="https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/">ImageMagick</a> to make some nice gifs.</p>
<figure><img src="goes17_fd_fc.gif"
         alt="GOES-17"/><figcaption>

<p>GOES satellites have a few imagers and some can be requested by government agencies to point at specific things for certain reasons, these 2 gifs/sets of images are 2 additional images that get produced.</p>
<figure><img src="goes17_m1_fc.gif"
         alt="GOES-17 M1, changed where it was pointing part of the way through"/><figcaption>

            <p>GOES-17 M2</p>

<p>You can read about what it is pointed at and why here at the <a href="https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Operations/messages.html">NOAA message list</a>.</p>
<p>The GOES satellites also have a relay system where they relay smaller images from a few other similar satellites.</p>

<p>I also received some National Weather Service data from the satellite&hellip;</p>

<p>Reading more about this specific satellite (GOES-17), it has definitely had some problems. Most notable was <a href="https://www.goes-r.gov/users/GOES-17-ABI-Performance.html">GOES-17 ABI cooling failure</a> which lead to them running reduced hours at different parts of the year to prevent the images from being over-saturated due to overheating.</p>
