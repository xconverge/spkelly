<p>This was essentially a break beam system however since there were multiple types of beams on the system, we could also tell direction. Filtering and adjustments were done for different animal sizes.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of one of the initial prototypes. You can see the laser photo receiver on the left and on the opposite side of the pole is an active powered infrared emitter/receiver combination sensor. The top of the pole had a small solar panel that kept the internals of the system powered.</p>
