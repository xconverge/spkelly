				<h1>SSTV Image From ISS</h1>

			<div class="content">
				<p>Ever since I started messing around with SDR and HAM radio, I have been eager to receive something from the ISS. I have tried a few times as it passed overhead with my handheld radio, but never had any luck.</p>
<p>A few times a year, the ISS transmits SSTV (slow-scan tv) signals with their onboard radio transmitter, to commemorate certain events. These can be monitored at ARISS (Amateur Radio on the International Space Station):</p>
<p><a href="http://ariss-sstv.blogspot.com/">http://ariss-sstv.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>These transmissions only last a few days, and you need to have a decent pass overhead of the ISS during this window to try and receive a signal.</p>
<p>Well the blog above had an event coming up that I wanted to try and receive!</p>
<p>&ldquo;SSTV from December 28, 2019 until January 1, 2020
ARISS will be supporting SSTV transmissions worldwide in memory of cosmonaut Alexei Leonov. Event runs from Dec 28 (11:00 UTC is the setup time) until Jan 1, 2020 (18:20 UTC when the system is scheduled for shutdown). Transmissions should be on the standard frequency of 145.800 MHz and in the PD 120 format.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I checked <a href="https://www.heavens-above.com/PassSummary.aspx">https://www.heavens-above.com/PassSummary.aspx</a> and found a pass that wasn&rsquo;t in the middle of the night (for my own sanity&hellip;)</p>
<p>I decided to use my SDR to record the audio transmission, so that I could post process the results after the fact and I could tweak the gain and do a bit of filtering as well if needed. I setup my dipole antenna for 145.8 MHz, tuned SDR# to 145.8 as well, and waited for the pass.</p>
<p>SSTV is pretty interesting, it takes about 100 seconds to receive 240 lines of a colored image using frequency modulation with a pretty small bandwidth of up to 3kHz!</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television</a></p>
<p>Since a pass lasts only a few minutes, I got the tail end of one image followed by a gap of transmission during the prime overhead portion of the pass, and a 2nd image during the tail end of the pass.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://hamsoft.ca/pages/mmsstv.php">MMSSTV</a> to decode the image from my recorded .wav of the pass. I set my computer up to loopback audio, set the input source in MMSSTV to be the output from my laptop with a <a href="https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/">virtual audio cable</a>, and used mode auto-detect (PD120).</p>
<p>Here is what the end/start of the images look like, there is a header that contains a start tone, some calibration data, and some other signalling codes that are used to identify the mode of encoding. This header is where the green line is.</p>
<p><img src="/sstv/startend.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the full image I got towards the end of the pass overhead!</p>
<p><img src="/sstv/full.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I submitted my image as proof to ARISS and received this certificate:</p>
<p><img src="/sstv/award.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Edit:
2 Days later, I was still within the transmission window and had another decent pass coming in. Here was what I got:</p>
<p><img src="/sstv/attempt_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Pretty frustrating, here is a diagram of the pass. The images take ~2 minutes to transmit, followed by 2 minutes of radio silence, and then they start transmission of a new image. I drew the red line on the 2 minutes of silence part of this &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; pass. The image I did get was on the tail end of the pass. I heard everything loud and clear on the entry and the exit, but the 2 minutes of silence during the prime portion was no fun!</p>

<p>I should have used my radio to ask them to slow down.</p>
