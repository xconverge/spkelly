<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/RTL-SDR-Blog-RTL2832U-Software-Defined/dp/B011HVUEME/">Amazon link</a></p>
<p>Then I installed some free software SDR# which allows you to tune filters and gain and install plugins.</p>
<p>First up, I wanted to try and capture data from a NOAA satellite as it passed overhead. These satellites are constantly transmitting data/images at 137MHz and when in range, this data can easily be received and decoded.</p>
<p>I setup my antenna for this particular type of signal and frequency range using this diagram:
<img src="adams_V-dipole.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="antenna.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then I opened up a program called WxTrack, put in my lat/long and was able to determine when the next pass would be.</p>
<p><img src="wxtrack.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I put my antenna outside, waited for the pass to start, and then started recording the audio as it was transmitted.</p>
<p><img src="noaa_waveform.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once the signal disappeared, I stopped the recording, and ran the file through <a href="https://github.com/martinber/noaa-apt">noaa-apt</a> which then helped generate this image!</p>
<p><img src="test1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next up I wanted to try and receive data from a newer satellite known as METEOR-M2. This is a newer russian satellite that transmits a digital signal. There was another METEOR satellite that was supposed to be launched in 2017, however didnâ€™t make it successfully to be operational. This digital signal then has to be demodulated and decoded into the image. This satellite has images that are ~10x higher resolution than the older NOAA satellites, however there is currently only 1 operational (vs ~4 for NOAA) so there are limited opportunities to receive data. Another is planned to be launched in July 2019, so we will see what sort of data that transmits! <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Here is the wave form during the METEOR-M2 pass:</p>
<p><img src="meteor-m2_waveform.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And then here is what was generated from the decoding of the data!</p>
<p><img src="2019-6-29-10-29-47-795-rectified.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next I wanted to track airplanes near me using their ADS-B protocol. This is a signal coming in at 1090MHz so this is the antenna configuration necessary:</p>
<p><img src="antenna2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I ran some software called RTL1090 which uses the hardware to decode the data being received and send it via TCP to PlanePlotter which shows the planes in a visual way</p>
<p><img src="Capture.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I verified with FlightAware that this data/flights/call signs matched!</p>

<p>:( from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_(satellite)#Meteor-M">wikipedia</a>:
&ldquo;On 5 July 2019, the replacement satellite for the failed Meteor-M No.2-1 satellite, the Meteor-M No.2-2 (also known as Meteor M2-2) was launched from Vostochny cosmodrome.</p>
<p>On 18 December 2019, image downlink from Meteor-M No.2-2 ceased. Tracking revealed the craft had suffered degradation in orbit with a 2 km (1.2 mi) decrease in perigee. NORAD was not able to identify any space object involved in a collision. Roscosmos later confirmed that the satellite had suffered a decompression of its thermal control system following what is presumed to be a micrometeoroid impact. Following the incident, the spacecraft was automatically switched into a low-power mode and ground operators worked to restore the satellite&rsquo;s orbit and orientation. By 25 December 2019, the satellite had resumed controlled flight, but the future of its mission remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Other Meteor-M satellites have been planned but their realization is uncertain.&rdquo; <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
