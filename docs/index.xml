      <description>This is a post that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve any computers or technology&amp;hellip; but has definitely consumed a TON of my time and effort in the past few years.
I first started making bread many years ago using the no knead method. It was easy, 4 ingredients, and the only piece of equipment needed was a dutch oven (~$40). The bread that came out of this tasted like magic. You put some raw boring ingredients in (flour, water, salt, and some instant yeast), and out came something warm, ready for a ton of butter.</description>

      <title>SSTV Image From ISS</title>

      <description>Ever since I started messing around with SDR and HAM radio, I have been eager to receive something from the ISS. I have tried a few times as it passed overhead with my handheld radio, but never had any luck.
A few times a year, the ISS transmits SSTV (slow-scan tv) signals with their onboard radio transmitter, to commemorate certain events. These can be monitored at ARISS (Amateur Radio on the International Space Station):</description>

      <title>Website Update</title>

      <description>Prior to this post, I had been hosting this website on a home server for a few years. It was originally just a project log using wordpress, without too much thought into how I would manage it.
Since 100% of the content is static, wordpress was overkill. For my use case, it was overcomplicated, slow-ish, and a potential security headache.
I considered converting all of the posts to individual HTML pages, with a decent index.</description>

      <description>SDR (Software defined radio) is a technology that shrinks all of the amplifiers/mixers/components of a radio system into a tiny USB dongle and some computer software.
This is the kit I bought for $30: Amazon link
Then I installed some free software SDR# which allows you to tune filters and gain and install plugins.
First up, I wanted to try and capture data from a NOAA satellite as it passed overhead.</description>

      <title>Battery Reconditioning</title>

      <description>Recently I came across a project where someone was using an off the shelf digital multimeter, power supply, and electronic load to recondition hybrid batteries. This involved disassembling the full pack of cells, testing, removing, and replacing bad cells, replacing contacts, etc, before doing multiple charge and discharge cycles to verify the improvement and condition of the battery. To charge, the power supply was turned on while logging with the DMM, to discharge, the eload was used in various modes (constant current, constant power) to quantify the capacity of the cell or pack of cells.</description>

      <title>Visual Studio Code VIM Extension</title>

      <description>Microsoft came out with an open source text editor called Visual Studio Code. The cool thing about this application was that it was cross-platform so I could move seamlessly between MacOS, Ubuntu, and Windows 10 and always be using the same editor, extensions, and environment. I will save the conversation about Electron, the framework that this application uses for another time.
I started using the VSCodeVim extension to have Vim style keybindings (essential for my productivity), but found quite a few annoyances with the plugin.</description>

I wanted a smoker so I chose the Weber Smokey Mountain! I got the 22″ version so that I can load it with a few racks of ribs with no issues.
This smoker uses charcoal as the heat source. Out of the box, you control the burn rate using vents on the bottom of the unit, with properly spread and lit charcoal, you can sustain 230 degrees for 7 or 8 hours with no problems before needing to add more fuel.</description>

      <description>This was a quick Friday afternoon project that turned into a demo of precise machine control for dispensing applications.
I wrote a GCode interpreter in C# that converts GCode to V+ which was used to control the Adept robot with the marker on the end. GCode is a language commonly used in machining and CNC primarily.
I then used a python based image to GCode library to convert images to GCode paths.</description>

      <description>My friend Vince and I wanted to put my new 3D printer (see previous post) to good use!
We decided to design and build a delta style pick and place robot from scratch.
Vince started with the CAD. A large majority of this project was done on the train to/from work. We decided on threaded rod for the parallel links, and some u-joints from McMaster-Carr for to give us some of the motion we needed.</description>

      <title>3D Printer Prusa i3</title>

      <description>I chose the Prusa i3 (http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3) as the 3D printer I wanted to build due to it’s rigidity and amount of information online related to it. At the time of making this, 3D printing was starting to get popular but was not NEARLY as popular as it is as you read this. Kits were not as available, amazon did not sell 3D printers, so I decided to make my own from plans and forum posts found online.</description>
