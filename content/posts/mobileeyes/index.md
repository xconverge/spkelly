I developed this iOS application to control an Adept mobile robot platform in my free time.

90% of this was done in hotels and airplanes while travelling for work.

I was able to VPN to work from a Southwest plane, and connect to a mobile robot and send it to different parts of the building using XCode from 40,000 feet.

Once I submitted the application to the Apple app store, they asked me to send them a video of the application working before they would approve it. Below is the video that I sent them. I thought it was interesting that they went through these lengths for every app that was requesting to be added to the store!
