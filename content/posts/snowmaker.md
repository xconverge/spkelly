I built a snowgun that used an air compressor and pressure washer to make ~3-4 inches per hour. An overnight run easily resulted in over a foot of snow in a pretty large area.

Conditions needed to be right, low humidity and temperatures < 34 or so. Using this chart I could find a night when everything lined up in October.

The problem is my backyard is flat... so I will need a drop in to do some jumps and rails with friends.

Keep in mind I did not know what CAD was at this time...

Perfect! Just need snow now (can see a pvc flat rail made in the back)

Cue the SM4 snowgun I made.

Decent coverage, does about 3 inches per hour over this area.

Time to leave it for the night and come back to it in the morning with some friends, skis, and snowboards.
